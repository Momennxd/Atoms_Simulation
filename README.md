- Build the solution by selecting `Build > Build Solution` or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`.

### 2. Copy SFML DLL Files
- After compiling, copy all the **SFML DLL files** from the SFML `bin` folder to the folder where the `.exe` is located (the output directory).
  - Example: `sfml-graphics-2.dll`, `sfml-window-2.dll`, `sfml-system-2.dll`, etc.
  
### 3. Copy the Config File
- Copy the necessary **config file** to the same folder where the `.exe` resides.

### 4. Run the Executable
- Once the DLL files and config are in place, run the `.exe` to start the simulation.
